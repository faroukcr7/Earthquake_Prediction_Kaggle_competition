# Earthquacke  Prediction 


## Overview

activation function : Sigmoid 

Optimazer  : RMS Optimazer based on gradient decent

number of inputs  :12 wich are the features of the cells  : 
age,sex,cp,trestbps,chol,fbs,restecg,thalach,exang,oldpeak,slope,ca,thal

number of hidden layers : 7 in the best cases 

number of output : 1 because its an binary clasification (Malignant begningn)

##### features :
